LittleBlitzer is a Windows tournament manager program for UCI based chess engines. It was created to enable
playing thousands of very fast games using multiple threads for chess engine testing purposes. It creates a
PGN file designed to be used by Bayeselo or Elostat to give a final rating for each engine.
